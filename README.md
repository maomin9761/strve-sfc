# strve-sfc

This JavaScript library is used to develop Strve single file components.

If you don't like the way template strings are written, the single-file component will help. Single-file components encapsulate the component's HTML template in a file ending in `.strve`, which gives you a better experience of quick code completion (requiring you to change the language mode to HTML). In addition, JavaScript logic and CSS styles are separated, making it easier for developers to maintain and modify components.

Please use it with `vite-plugin-strve`.
